    <h1 id="appropriate-freedom-of-speech"><strong>Appropriate Freedom of Speech</strong></h1>
<p>​ America <strong>has long been</strong> one of the most free speech nations. Instead, China is the target of criticism from the Western media for its &ldquo;lack of freedom of speech&rdquo;. As a native Chinese student, let&rsquo;s talk about the so-called freedom of speech, why our country “lacks” this freedom, and most importantly, is it reasonable for our country to stay that way.</p>
<p>​ <strong>To start with</strong>, we should understand the definition of freedom of speech. <strong>Generally speaking</strong>, it&rsquo;s the right that civilians can communicate e one&rsquo;s opinions and ideas without worrying about the government&rsquo;s censorship and retaliation. It originated with The First Amendment, the publication of which affect the whole world so much because it gave people the right of expressing their freedom of thinking. Human is not a rigid animal, which means many human activities require the spark of different ideas. That&rsquo;s why there is a huge development in culture, technology even the military.</p>
<p>​ Freedom of speech can be subdivided into two parts, speech involving politics and freedom of speech that doesn&rsquo;t involve politics. In my opinion, China and the United States are roughly at a level of freedom of expression that does not involve politics. As the country with the largest number of Internet users in the country, China has a high degree of development of Internet speech, and people&rsquo;s thinking has blossomed, especially in recent years. We can discuss almost any speech on the Internet that is not involved in politics, and we will also receive &ldquo;free&rdquo; replies from netizens. Of course, there will be malice, which is also the embodiment of free speech.</p>
<p>​ But it is also beyond reproach to say that freedom of speech in China is incomplete. When it comes to speech that involves politics, we tend to be constrained by some <em>friendliness</em>. This is often an unspoken rule that Chinese people are well versed in. In China, people who announce unpredictive remarks against the government tend to be dangerous and troublesome. Since the founding of China, we have been a staunch one-party dictatorship, and freedom of expression is likely to be used by renegades to subvert the regime. Since the reform and opening up, the government has given the people a great right to freedom of speech, which has made us very satisfied. As ordinary people, we understand that in a country with one party and government, if there is a high degree of freedom of speech, the people can freely attack the government, which is bound to cause social unrest and bring disadvantages to China&rsquo;s economic development. This is also the difference that the Chinese and American people have been discussing for a long time.</p>
<p>​ Freedom of speech is surely a positive matter <strong>for the reason that it</strong> can liberate, and free human beings from the shackles of thinking. <strong>But freedom without borders is not freedom.</strong> If you go to a company and scold your boss on your first day on the job, what will be the consequences? This situation should be uniform throughout the world. The First Amendment protects your attacks on the government from being censored but doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that your remarks to the boss won&rsquo;t result in dismissal.</p>
<p>​ It is true that the West has liberalized people&rsquo;s criticism of the government, but is the effect of this criticism significant? The West advocates freedom of speech in this way because their long-term partisan competitive relationship needs to be purified by freedom of speech, and freedom of speech is needed to invest in the fierce competition of their party and develop in competition. However, in today&rsquo;s media, which is often controlled by a small number of giant capitals, we can also see how much malicious competition there is. Social unrest caused by the vicious competition of countless parties is something that China does not want to encounter. At the same time, to make the one-party dictatorship unshakable in China, we will also control the degree of people&rsquo;s discussion of politics.</p>
<p>​ China&rsquo;s inability to let go of free speech is also partly because of the lessons learned from the military crackdown on the student movement in the summer of the 1989 since the reform and opening up. After China attempted to liberalize free speech, the Communist Party did suffer from the dominant social unrest of the student movement. Students seek political openness, but for the Communist Party, it is a malicious act of challenging party and government power. Since the crackdown, the deepening of freedom of expression on the political front has also become more difficult.</p>
<p>As a result, we can see the benefits of free speech, but for every country I still think that appropriate freedom of speech is justified, and when the government reaches the point of restricting the minds of the people, it is worth the real protest. Obviously not yet.</p>
